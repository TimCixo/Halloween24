## How to use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open it in Unity.
3. Run the scene.

## Sprites

All sprites were created by [Microsoft designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/).

### Ghosts

The prompt for ghost sprites was `sprite minimalistic cartoon ghost. [emotion]. takes off. front view`.

### Candies

The prompt for candy sprites was `minimalistic cartoon [color] candy`.

I don't know why - it's impossible to get rid of their faces.

### Code

Movement works. Spawner is not the best but still works. Player... I don't want to talk about it.
